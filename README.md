# frame-oss-alexa

Alexa skill for [frame-oss](https://github.com/bpmct/frame-oss), open digital picture frame software. This doesn't work yet, but aims to provide the following functionality:

- Show your photo gallery on Echo Show clock instead of siloed photo gallery
- Open browser with full frame upon request (e.g "Alexa, open smart frame")

I have an Amazon Echo Show 5 and will be occasionally working on this. To streamline deployment via the [Alexa Skills Toolkit](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-toolkit/get-started-with-the-ask-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code.html) extension, this is in a seperate repo from frame-oss.

If you have requests or would like to work on this, [see this issue](https://github.com/bpmct/frame-oss/issues/3)
