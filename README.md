Alexa skill for [frame-oss](https://github.com/bpmct/frame-oss), open digital picture frame software.

⚠️ This doesn't work yet. I have an Amazon Echo Show 5 and will be occasionally working on this to achieve the following functionality:

- Show your photo gallery on Echo Show clock instead of the limited options with the photo gallery
- Open browser with full frame upon request (e.g "Alexa, open smart frame")

Today, you can use Alexa's default browser, Silk, to render the frame but it is not a great experience and cannot be configured to show on startup: "Alexa, open Silk."

To streamline deployment via the [Alexa Skills Toolkit](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-toolkit/get-started-with-the-ask-toolkit-for-visual-studio-code.html) extension, this is in a seperate repo from frame-oss. If you have requests or would like to work on this, [see this issue](https://github.com/bpmct/frame-oss/issues/3).
